# Predictive Analytics : House Price Prediction

House price prediction project written in Python, as part of the Predictive Analytics at LTU (Luleå Tekniska
Universitet).

> House pricing prediction is a challenging but critical issue in today’s real estate market. Imagine a scenario where
> buyers, sellers, and even banks are all trying to figure out the right price for a property. A slight miscalculation
> could mean that a house stays on the market for months or a bank makes a risky loan decision. Research and industry
> data suggest that using predictive analytics to accurately gauge property prices can streamline the sales process,
> help investors decide where to put their money, and provide financial institutions with more secure data when
> approving loans.
